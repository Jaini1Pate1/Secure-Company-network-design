This project was my part of learning the way to secure company network.
As I was going through it I have learn many thing, from just make my coffee cold.

I have learned about many thing which I was not familiar with before this project.
Like, I have first configured Wireless access control in different VLAN than AP (access points).
I know that is dumb, but hey, it was my first time I was configuring access control.
Every one make mistake in first time (not on bed ðŸ˜œ)

I might be not best at explaining but you can read my report and see packet tracer to see what I have configured.

Let me know if I have miss something.
